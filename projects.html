The writer was part of the Entrepreneur Track, team ENTR-H128, where this team created a mobile application called SatSet. SatSet is an innovative mobile application designed to connect users experiencing technical issues with qualified technicians in their vicinity, dealing with electrical systems, plumbing, household appliances, or computers. This platform ensures that users can quickly and easily find experienced professional technicians. In this final project, the writer took on the role of a machine learning engineer along with a fellow teammate. The team itself consisted of 7 members, including 3 machine learning engineers, 2 android developers, and 2 cloud engineers.</p>
